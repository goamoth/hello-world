# hello-world

This is the first repository that is generated when one creates a GitHub account. It's a good starting point as you get to learn how to manage a repository, edit the README file, create a branch and even add source code files.

Just to a dd a flavour to it I thought about doing a simple Hello Word in JavaScript and add a simple test case using Mocha/Chai.

Cheers!
