# hello-world

This is the first repository that is generated when one creates a GitHub account... 

We all know this and it's a good starting point as you get to learn how to manage *a repository*, edit the *README file*, create *a branch* and even add *source code files*.

### I thought about making it a little bit cool!
I decided not to delete it and thought I should do a simple Hello World in JavaScript and add a simple test case using Mocha/Chai.
  
#### Want to see it?
Go to 
[goamoth.github.io/hello-world/](https://goamoth.github.io/hello-world/)
then click the button, add your name to the prompt and click OK... **Hello World shouts from [YourName]!**

Cheers!
